# Tely 10 Mile Road Race Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project was developed for the COMP 4304 course, focusing on creating data visualizations for the Tely 10 Mile Road Race. Over a 15-year period, comprehensive race data was analyzed and visualized to evaluate the race's success from various perspectives such as organizers, sponsors, participants, and the public.

## Visualizations
The project includes three unique visualizations:
1. Evolution of participant numbers over the years.
2. Geographical diversity of participants.
3. Trends in average finish times.

These visualizations were created using Python, primarily employing libraries within the Matplotlib ecosystem like Seaborn.
